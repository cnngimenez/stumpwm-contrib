** Usage
Put:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "cpu")
#+END_SRC
In your =~/.stumpwmrc=

Then you can use: =%C= into your modeline to add CPU information. For example, the following code adds CPU information at the begining of the modeline:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (push "%C | " *screen-mode-line-format*)
#+END_SRC

The result would be a modeline with the following string:

: CPU:  10%  (480 MHZ) 10Â°C AVG: 0.22 0.30 0.41 | [Default]  0+firefox ...

The =cpu:*cpu-modeline-fmt*= variable modifies what to show on the modeline when "%C" is used. Its value is a string used by format. Check its documentiation with =(describe '*cpu-modeline-fmt*)=.
It has the following percent codes in the string:

| Code | Description              |
|------+--------------------------|
| %c   | CPU usage as %           |
| %C   | CPU usage as bar graph   |
| %t   | CPU temperature          |
| %f   | CPU frequency            |
| %l   | Load average information |
